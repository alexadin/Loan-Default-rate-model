#Training a logistic regression
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
#Called as a function with or without parameters
clf_logistic = LogisticRegression(solver = 'lbfgs')
#Uses the method . fit() to train
clf_logitics.fit(training_columns, np.ravel(training_labels)

#Training Columns: all of the columns in our data except loan_status

x = cr_loan.drop('loan_status'. axis = 1)
y  = cr_loan [['loan_status']]

Use train_test_split() function already within sci-kit learn

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_sizae = .4, random_state = 123)

X = cr_loan_clean[["loan_int_rate"]]
y = cr_loan_clean[["loan_status"]]

# Create and fit a logistic regression model
clf_logistic_single = LogisticRegression(solver ='lbfgs')
clf_logistic_single.fit(X, np.ravel(y))

# Print the parameters of the model
print(clf_logistic_single.get_params())

# Print the intercept of the model
print(clf_logistic_single.intercept_)
